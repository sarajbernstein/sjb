<h2>Book Project: <i>What Might Have Been</i></h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p><i>What Might Have Been</i> argues for the surprising thesis that would-be causes-- events that could have brought about outcomes, but didn't-- are causes <i>simpliciter</i>. Broadening the category of causation resolves key philosophical puzzles about the nature of causation, and sheds new light on the relationship between causation and moral responsibility.<br /><br />
	Billy and Suzy each shoot Victim; Billy’s bullet pierces Victim’s heart, ensuring his death; Suzy’s bullet hits Victim’s heart seconds later. It is natural to think of Billy’s bullet as the <i>actual</i> cause of Victim’s death and Suzy’s bullet as a merely <i>possible</i> or “backup” cause. One goal of causal theories is to cordon off actual from merely possible causes—in this case, to explain what makes the relationship between Billy’s bullet and Victim’s death different from the relationship between Suzy’s (backup) bullet and Victim’s death.<br /><br />
		Maintaining the distinction between actual and possible causes has proven supremely difficult to causation theorists. Cases of <i>preemption</i> like the one involving Suzy and Billy have plagued accounts of causation according to which the outcome depends on a particular cause for its occurrence. An event can raise the chance that an outcome will occur without causing the outcome, which has proven problematic for probability-raising accounts of causation. Our ordinary understanding of causation distinguishes between omissions that cause and omissions that could have caused. But energy transfer accounts of causation cannot easily handle causation by omission involving would-be events, since there is no actual event to or from which energy can be transferred. These theories resort to complicated emendations to maintain the distinction between actual and possible causes.<br /><br />
       	<i>Contra</i> orthodoxy, I argue that we should abandon a sharp distinction between possible and actual causes altogether. I develop the view that actual and possible causation are both species of a common genus: what I call <i>causal relevance</i>. Consider an event c, such as Suzy’s shooting of Victim, and an effect e, such as Victim’s death. C is causally relevant to e if c brings about e in a nearby possible world. There is such a world: one in which Billy did not fire. As such, causal relevance is a continuum reflected by distance from actuality: The most causally relevant event is the cause of the outcome in the actual world (Billy’s firing), followed by events that, in increasingly distant possible worlds, bring about the outcome. Should we so choose, we can then draw traditional distinction between actual and possible causes: the actual cause is simply the most causally relevant c. The rest are merely possible causes, but are causes nonetheless.<br /><br />
       	I offer two major arguments to support this broadening of the category of causation. First, I argue that nothing metaphysically significant undergirds the distinction between actual and possible causation. Some causal theorists hold that causation is an “oomph” or transfer of energy from cause to effect. But this is an overly simplistic picture of causation, and "oomph" doesn't track a joint-carving or metaphysically distinctive relation. Once we reject "oomph" theory, we are free to view actual and possible causes on a metaphysical par.<br /><br />
       	Second, I argue that possible causation is as useful as actual causation in explanation, prediction, and moral evaluation. To support this idea, I turn to examples of causation by omission. Consider the recent example of the Air France pilot who failed to increase the airplane’s speed, thus causing the plane to crash. Intuitively, the pilot’s failure to increase the airplane’s speed caused the plane to go down. Based on my <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11098-013-0229-0#page-1">(2014)</a>, I argue that the best way to understand such omissions is as possibilities: partly, an omission is a merely possible event. The omitted increase in airspeed identifies a world in which the pilot does increase his airspeed. With this idea in mind, consider the following pair of cases:<br /><br />
       	
	(Button Pressing) If the airline pilot presses a particular button, the plane will malfunction and crash. The pilot presses the button, and the plane crashes.<br /><br />
       	
	(Omitted Button Pressing) If the airline pilot fails to press a particular button, the plane will malfunction and crash. The pilot fails to press the button, and the plane crashes.<br /><br />

In these cases, the button-pressing and the failure to press the button respectively ensure that the plane crashes; both the button-pressing and the failure to press the button explain the plane’s crash; and the pilot is equally morally responsible for the outcome in both cases. Using these cases and others, I suggest that there is predictive, explanatory, and moral parity between actual and possible causes.

<h3>Chaper Summary</h3>

<p class="indent5">1. <b>Chapter 1</b> introduces the central problem of the metaphysics of causation: when are two events, such as the dropping of the atomic bomb and Japan’s surrender, causally related? I provide historical background for the metaphysics of causation. I also present examples of causes and effects that might have been, and discuss the importance of these would-be causal sequences not only for causal theorists, but for those interested in dependent concepts such as scientific explanation and moral responsibility.<br /><br />

2. <b>Chapter 2</b> runs through several contemporary theories of causation, including the counterfactual account, the energy transfer account, the interventionist view, and the probabilistic view, and shows how each view runs into intractable problems distinguishing between actual and possible causation.<br /><br />

3. <b>Chapter 3</b> articulates and defines the thesis of the book: causal relevance, rather than actual causation, is the most helpful metaphysical category for understanding causal phenomena. Actual causation and possible causation are species of this genus. C is causally relevant to e if c brings about e in a nearby possible world or in the actual world. Causal relevance is a continuum reflected by distance from actuality: the most causally relevant event is the cause of the outcome in the actual world (Billy’s firing), followed by events that, in increasingly distant possible worlds, bring about the outcome.<br /><br />

4. <b>Chapter 4</b> argues that nothing metaphysically significant undergirds the distinction between actual and possible causation. A prominent causal theory holds that causation is a matter of physical energy transfer between cause and effect. I argue that this is an overly simplistic picture of causation, and does not capture many cases that are, in fact, causal. Dispensing with the idea that energy transfer is necessary for causation enables us to see that actual and possible causes are on a metaphysical par.<br /><br />

5. <b>Chapter 5</b> tackles causation by omission, and advances the thesis that omissions are best understood as causally relevant possible events. This thesis resolves ontological, semantic, and moral puzzles about omissions, and shows that possible events play predictive, explanatory, and moral roles as actual causes.<br /><br />

6. <b>Chapter 6</b> addresses redundant causation, scenarios in which there are multiple causes sufficient to bring about an outcome. I explain how causal relevance solves conceptual, metaphysical, and taxonomic problems about redundant causation, a topic that has particularly dominated causation literature in the past decade..<br /><br />

7. <b>Chapter 7</b> extends the results of causal relevance to moral and legal responsibility. I focus on two specific issues. First, I show how causal relevance eliminates moral luck, cases in which luck makes a difference to an agent’s moral responsibility for an outcome. Second, I show that causal relevance is a better guide to legal responsibility than existing theories of causation utilized by the law.<br /><br />
